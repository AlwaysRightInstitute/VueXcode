Want to edit Vue components in Xcode, but they just show up in black&white?
Trying to change the file type using the 'Type' popup, 
but Xcode can't remember?
Enter VueXcode.

This impressive macOS application features a stunning info panel
(it also registers a custom UTI for .vue files).
Grab the application, run it once, and in the future your Vue components
show up in pretty colors:
